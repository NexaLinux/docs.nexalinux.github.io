We appreciate you choosing Nexa Linux!

## Obtain the Installation Image

Head over to the [Download](https://nexalinux.xyz/download) page and grab the latest ISO file.

### Validate the Hash

Verifying the image hash is strongly recommended before use, particularly when downloading from a HTTP mirror, as downloads can be intercepted and [tampered with](https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/stork/packagemanagersecurity/attacks-on-package-managers.html).

==- Retrieve the SHA-256 checksum for your image
Filename | SHA-256
--- | ---
nexalinux_dev_2025.3_amd64_2025-03-16_0818.iso | 7b210266ea8e765f10a63be518fe911a4d3e8687d1d3d3baa25dd5f2cb44a2e1

===
To verify the SHA-256 checksum, execute the following command, replacing `<filename>` with the ISO's actual name and `<sha256>` with the corresponding hash.

+++ Windows
Open Windows PowerShell and run:

```cmd
certutil -hashfile <filename>.iso SHA256
```

Compare the output with the hash you got from here.

+++ Linux/macOS
Open Terminal and enter:

```bash
echo "<sha256> <filename>.iso" | sha256sum -c
```
